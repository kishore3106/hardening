1.What is the command to set the grub password?
solution:

    To set a GRUB password (for GRUB2), follow these steps:

    1. Generate a GRUB password hash:
    Use the grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 command to generate a hashed password:


    grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
    Enter your desired password when prompted.

    You’ll get output like this:


    PBKDF2 hash of your password is grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    2. Edit the GRUB configuration file:
    Open /etc/grub.d/40_custom with a text editor:


    sudo nano /etc/grub.d/40_custom
    Add the following lines:

    set superuser="admin"
    password_pbkdf2 admin grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    Replace "admin" with your desired username and paste the hashed password.

    3. Update GRUB:
    After editing the config, update GRUB so the changes take effect:


    sudo update-grub
    4. (Optional) Restrict menu entries:
    To restrict specific menu entries (like recovery mode), edit /etc/grub.d/10_linux or other appropriate scripts and add:

    menuentry 'Your Entry' --users admin {
        ...
    }

2.How to run the script ubuntu.sh?
Solution:
    To run a script like ubuntu.sh on Ubuntu (or any Linux distribution), follow these steps:

    1. Make sure the script is executable
    Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing ubuntu.sh, then run:


    chmod +x ubuntu.sh
    This command gives the script execute permission.

   2. Run the script
    There are two common ways to run the script:

    ➤ If you're in the same directory:

    ./ubuntu.sh
    ➤ If you want to use a shell explicitly:
    
    bash ubuntu.sh
    or


    sh ubuntu.sh
    Bonus Tips:
    If the script requires sudo (i.e. root privileges), run:

    
    sudo ./ubuntu.sh
    If you get a "command not found" or "permission denied" error, make sure:

    You’re in the correct directory.

    The script has Unix line endings (not Windows \r\n).
    You can convert it using:


    dos2unix ubuntu.sh
